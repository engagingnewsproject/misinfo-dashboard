[Getting Started](https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard/?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) | [Firebase Emulator](https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard/?tab=readme-ov-file#4-install-and-run-firebase-emulator) | [Firebase](https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard/?tab=readme-ov-file#firebase-functions) | [Push to Netlify](https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard/?tab=readme-ov-file#project-lead-push-to-netlify-live-site)

This project project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) of the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. To learn more about Next.js features and API, take a look at [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

**See [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard/blob/main/technicalDocumentation.md)** for Project Structure, Firebase, Components and Git Usage docs.


## Already set up?

Simple. Run two commands in separate terminal tabs:

```
firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data
```

and...

```
yarn dev
```

Not set up? Keep reading...

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone repo

First step! Clone this repo into a local directory (ex. `~/username/sites/`) on your machine.

- From the command line in your project root run:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard.git
    ```
 
### 2. Install Packages

#### Node Version

At this time of writing (April 26, 2024) the latest working update is at Node v20.12.2. Ensure this is the version by running `node -v`. If you are not on that Node version check out this article to set the correct Node version: [Easily switch between multiple Node versions without using nvm](https://dev.to/andreasbergstrom/easily-switch-between-multiple-node-versions-without-using-nvm-52k9).

#### Yarn
Install/update [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager on your machine ([installation docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
  
- Enable [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack), if it isn't already; this will add the `yarn` binary to your PATH:

    ```
    corepack enable
    ```

- Set the yarn version by running:

```
yarn set version 1.22.1
```

- From the root of the project install dependencies by running:
        
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
  
    > _**Why not `npm install`?** Glad you asked! [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the service that hosts the dashboard, will not allow us to upload updates because `npm install` creates a `package-lock.json` file. Netlify doesn't like `package-lock.json` files._

### 3. Add Firebase configuration

In order to be authenticated with the Firebase Project you must have the `.env` file (which contains the Firebase credentials) at the root of your project. To get the contents of the `.env` file reach out to the project lead (currently [Luke](https://github.com/luukee)).

### 4. Install and run Firebase Emulator

Firebase Emulator is included in the [Firebase Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools) package. You can install Firebase Tools by running:

```
curl -sL firebase.tools | bash
```

Next, to run the app on the emulator and import the testing db data, in a _new_ terminal tab run: 

```
firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data
``` 

See [Emulator Tips](https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/misinfo-dashboard?tab=readme-ov-file#emulator-tips) for more info.

### 5. Start dev server

To boot up the development server run:

```
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

> _If you open `http://localhost:3000` and you see the "unhandled error" `FirebaseError: Failed to get document because the client is offline.` this means you have not started the Firebase Emulator. Return to step #4 to Install and run the Firebase Emulator._

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. If you have the emulator running you will see a banner `Running in emulator mode. Do not use with production credentials.` at the bottom of your screen as well as Console log messages letting you know that the emulator is running:

![emulator-running](https://media.github.austin.utexas.edu/user/3619/files/fa9f1c63-1f3a-4dd2-b0d3-2ca3ab6b86f0)

> NOTE: You will have 2 terminal tabs running while developing:
- > 1 terminal tab for `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`), 
- > 1 terminal tab for `firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data`. 

> NOTE: You will also have 2 browser tabs open while developing:
- > 1 browser tab for `localhost:3000` (actual misinfo dashboard), 
- > 1 browser tab for "Firebase Emulator Suite" 

Develop away! And good luck :)

## Emulator Tips:

> _If you get `command not found` you might have to be added as a user for the Firebase project. Contact the lead developer to do this for you. Or contact mediaengagement@austin.utexas.edu_

The Firebase Emulator should boot up and provide you an emulator link (look for `View Emulator UI at` in your command line output). 

Open that link to view the Emulator UI:

![emulator-ui](https://media.github.austin.utexas.edu/user/3619/files/1012c2ee-b9b2-4529-8914-2e0455af9bda)

**See Emulator Tips** for more info.

### Add yourself as a user via the "Emulator Authentication" tab. 

#### Two options:

1. Option one: Manually add yourself

   From the Firebase Emulator UI select the "Emulator Authentication" tab and click "Add user". Only required fields are: `name`, `email` and `password`. Change your role? see _Available user roles_ below.

2. Option two: Sign up.

   You can also signup like a normal user at the Login/Signup page. Once you have signed up:

    - Open the link printed out in your Emulator terminal window. 
      - **_all you need to do is open the link._ Once you've opened the link close the tab and...
    - Return to your initial Signup tab and login with the credentials you signed up with. Change your role? see _Available user roles_ below.

#### Available user roles:

- *General User:*
    
    No additional configuration required.
    
- *Agency User:*

    In the "Custom Claims" input enter `{"agency":true}` & save.

- *Admin User:*

    In the "Custom Claims" input enter `{"admin":true}` & save.
    

#### Emulator UI
- Database: find the imported database under the Emulator UI / Firestore tab.
- Users: view, add, edit & delete users under the Authentication tab.
- Files & Uploads: Storage tab in the Emulator UI.

#### Users

Your user UID that you created will not be associated with any reports or agencies so you can either add reports via the Misinfo Dashboard in your localhost:3000 window or go into the Emulator UI and manually change the `userID` to your own for some reports. Same idea with assigning your user to an agency: go into the Emulator UI and add your email to an agency's `agencyUsers` field.

#### Emulator log files

Emulator creates log files (`firebase-debug.log` & `ui-debug.log`) when you boot up the emulator. No need to push those with git. 

#### Export your local emulator data

The Firebase emulator allows you to export data from your running emulator instance. If you want to stash a baseline set of data, auth profiles you have set up in your running emulator instance.

`firebase emulators:export ./emulator-data`

This command will export the running emulator instance's auth profiles, firestore data and storage files to the `/emulator-data` folder. **Recommended** to not commit the `/emulator-data` changed files as to not alter the baseline Emulator data.

## Firebase Functions

To deploy Firebase functions:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

#### Firebase Creds

With proper permissions access Firebase Console or Firebase Cloud Console.

- Firebase project name: Misinfo
- Firebase project ID: misinfo-5d004
- Firebase project #: 2581605663

#### Firebase Storage

- Firebase storage name: misinfo-5d004.appspot.com

## Integration of AuthContext and Firebase Functions

The `AuthContext.jsx` file in your React application interacts with the Firebase functions defined in `functions/index.js` through HTTPS callable functions. This setup allows your front-end application to communicate with the backend Firebase environment in a structured and secure manner.

### How It Works:

1. **Firebase Functions (`functions/index.js`)**:
   This file defines various cloud functions that you deploy to Firebase. These functions can perform operations such as user authentication management (e.g., adding roles, fetching user data), interacting with Firebase Firestore, and other tasks that require server-side execution.

2. **React Context (`context/AuthContext.jsx`)**:
   This file creates a React context that holds the user's authentication state and provides various authentication-related functions across your React application. It utilizes the functions defined in `functions/index.js` through HTTPS callable methods, such as `addAdminRole`, `addAgencyRole`, and `fetchUserRecord`.

    - **HTTPS Callable Functions**: These are Firebase functions that are exposed via an HTTPS endpoint. In your React app, you use `httpsCallable` from Firebase to invoke these functions. This method sends a POST request to the corresponding function's URL and gets the response.

### Example Flow:

- **Add Role**: When you want to add a role to a user, your React component calls `addAdminRole` or `addAgencyRole` through the context. This context function then calls the respective HTTPS callable function, which in turn invokes the cloud function in Firebase. The cloud function performs the necessary operations (like setting custom claims) and returns the result.

- **Fetch User Record**: When you need to fetch details about a user, your component accesses `fetchUserRecord` from the context. This function uses `getUserRecord` (defined as an HTTPS callable function) to retrieve user details from Firebase Authentication.

### Connecting the Dots:

- **AuthContext Integration**: In your React components, you use the context to perform operations that involve authentication or user management. For instance, upon user login, you might call `login` from the context, which handles the sign-in process using Firebase Authentication.

- **Security and Accessibility**: By managing these operations through cloud functions and context, you ensure that sensitive operations are securely handled on the server side, minimizing exposure to the client side, and you maintain a clean separation of concerns.
